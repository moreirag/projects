# Welcome to the CSILab

If you wanna be a student or collaborator in the [CSILab](http://www.decom.ufop.br/csilab/), here you will find information about how we work and tons of interesting projects to join in.

The fields we work in are:

 - Network science / Complex networks / Complex systems
 - Multiobjective optimization
 - Machine Learning / Deep Learning
 - Data Science

Find below some general guidelines for our students:
 - **Git**: Create a git project named 'FirstNameLastName' with 2 folders: 'code' (for your code), 'thesis' (for your latex files). We encourage everyone to also use overleaf for writing. If possible, sync overleaf with the git repository. Keep everything in your git up to date.
 - **Planning**: Planning is essential. Make a spreadsheet with a schedule (planning timeline) with goals to be achieved. Hold frequent meetings with your supervisor (preferably on weekly bases) and closely monitor your planning timeline schedule with him. Your supervisor probably has a lot of students under his supervision, and he won't be able to remember everyone's schedule in his head. 
 - **Experiment tracking**: Organize your git repository. We strongly recommend using an experiment tracking tool such as [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html).
 - **CSILabs servers and GPUs**: We have powerful computers in our laboratory, with powerful GPUS, available for you to run your experiments (don't stress your laptop!!). Access to the lab machines is done remotely and managed by Prof. Pedro Silva. Drop an email to Prof. Pedro (with a copy to your advisor) for instructions on how to use our infra.
 - **Working with Deep Learning**: Training deep learning models for research is a difficult process. Finding hyperparameters and architectures can be a tricky activity for beginners. If your model does not converge or is performing poorly, before going to your supervisor, take a look at the tutorials: [Deep Learning Tuning Playbook](https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook), and [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/).
 - **Stuck?:**: Meet your supervision more often and open yourself to him. We are here to help you!
