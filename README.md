# Welcome to the CSILab

If you wanna be a student or collaborator in the [CSILab](http://www.decom.ufop.br/csilab/), here you will find information about how we work and tons of interesting projects to join in.

The fields we work in are:

 - Network science / Complex networks / Complex systems
 - Multiobjective optimization
 - Machine Learning / Deep Learning
 - Data Science


Professors:

Find below some general guidelines for our students:
- **Planning**: Planning is essential. Make a spreadsheet with a schedule (planning timeline) with goals to be achieved. Hold frequent meetings with your supervisor (preferably on weekly bases) and closely monitor your planning timeline schedule with him. Your supervisor probably has a lot of students under his supervision, and he won't be able to remember everyone's schedule. Don't be afraid to email your supervisor or even knock on his office door.
 - **Git**: Before everything, create a git project named 'FirstNameLastName' with 2 folders: 'code' (for your code), and 'thesis' (for your latex files). We also encourage everyone to use [overleaf](overleaf.com) for writing. If possible, sync overleaf with the git repository. Keep everything in your git up to date.
 - **Experiment tracking**: Organize your git repository. We strongly recommend using an experiment tracking tool such as [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html).
 - **CSILab servers and GPUs**: We have nice computers in our laboratory (128Gb RAM, >40 cores), with powerful GPUS (RTX 3090, etc), available for you to run your experiments (don't stress your laptop!!). Access to the lab machines is done remotely and managed by Prof. Pedro Silva (silvap@ufop.edu.br). Drop an email to Prof. Pedro (with a copy to your supervisor) for instructions on how to use our infra-structure.
 - **Be an active member of the lab**: Participate, use our physical space, meet other students and the professors. Live the lab! The exchange of knowledge is very important! Ask your supervisor to add you to the Lab's WhatsApp and Slack groups.
 - **Working with Deep Learning**: Training deep learning models is a difficult task. Finding good hyperparameters and architectures can be a tricky activity for beginners. If your model does not converge or is performing poorly, before going to your supervisor, take a look at the tutorials: [Deep Learning Tuning Playbook](https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook), and [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/).
 - **Don't reinvent the wheel!** Start from good code repositories. Get to know [PaperWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/).
 - **How to write good papers**: Writing is a fundamental task for the researcher/scientist. The Prof. Jan Van Gemert has a great [guideline](https://jvgemert.github.io/writing.pdf) on how write good research paper. In our lab **we strongly recommend** following Prof. Jan Van Gemert's [guideline](https://jvgemert.github.io/writing.pdf) for papers, dissertations and theses. We recommend reading it multiple times. Also, keep in mind that to write good papers, you need to have contact with papers, lots of them! Read good papers, well-written papers! Example of a well-written [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/120NzsHVYev8PTId9paXsjG2eFdxF1Gd1/view?usp=share_link). Yet another great article on how to write better papers: [Heuristics for Scientific Writing (a Machine Learning Perspective)](https://www.approximatelycorrect.com/2018/01/29/heuristics-technical-scientific-writing-machine-learning-perspective/).
 - **Use a template to start you paper**: The Prof. Jan Van Gemert also has a great [skeleton guidelines](https://jvgemert.github.io/paper_skeleton.rtf) on how to write a paper. Here is an [example of an  article skeleton](https://jvgemert.github.io/paper_skeleton_example_CVPR20.rtf) from Prof. Gemert.
 
 - **Stuck?**: Meet your supervisor more often and open yourself to him. We are here to help you!
 - **For PPGCC students**: Get to know the program's [regiment](http://www3.decom.ufop.br/pos/resolucoes/) and be aware of the deadlines. You are the one who should take care of your work. Follow the [PPGCC](http://www3.decom.ufop.br/pos/inicio/) website and the social media.
 - **For undergrad students**: Pay attention to IC deadlines and check the [PROPPI website](https://propp.ufop.br/pt-br/pesquisa/iniciacao-cientifica) frequently.
 - **PPGCC/UFOP template** for your [TCC](), [Thesis]() and [Dissertation]().
