> Description: In this project, we propose the classification of heartbeats through graph neural networks in order to extract features simultaneously from two ECG leads plus one temporal component. The premise is that by relating two ECG derivatives in time, new information can be detected and thus enhance the extraction of a more robust feature vector. Additionally, we aim to investigate ways of reducing computational and memory cost, in order to facilitate integration with medical equipment through hardware accelerators.

> Results: In previous works, we investigated the impact of considering more than one ECG lead on arrhythmia classification [article 1], and we even proposed a new representation of a heartbeat with three dimensions, which we called the temporal vectorcardiogram (TVCG) [article 2]. We explored complex network techniques to extract features and performed table classification. In current work, we are exploring feature extraction directly from raw data through graph neural networks [article 3, article 4]. Currently, we are exploring the techniques on two databases, the MITDB and the database explored in [article 5]. The most current code, maintained by the Master's student Rafael Oliveira, can be found at [link]. For a good understanding of the problem, we recommend reading our survey at [link].

> Work to be done: Current results show that the approach via Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is promising [article 3, article 4], however, there is still much to be done to make it feasible for clinical use, especially in terms of computational cost. Currently, we need (1) to find/develop more efficient implementations of the visibility graph technique (used to transform a heartbeat into a graph) and (2) to employ the visibility graph on two ECG derivatives at the same time (visibility graph in 2 dimensions). Another research path is (3) to study other ways of mapping a heartbeat (which is a one-dimensional signal) into a graph.
