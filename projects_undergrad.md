# Undergraduate - Scientific Initiation [IC] and Honours thesis [TCC]


## Network science / Complex networks / Complex systems

1) **Front-end for the TSAPI and the generation/analysis of functional networks**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
>
> The former student involved: Vinicius Silva (http://www.monografias.ufop.br/handle/35400000/4934) 
>
> Description: The TSAPI is a distributed API that compares sets of time series against each other, producing similarity matrices as output. This project aims to build a front end that consumes the TSAPI and generates functional networks from the similarity matrices, analyze the networks, and shows plots with metrics and distributions. 

2) **Experiment design with the TSAPI for time series generation and analysis**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas 
> 
> The former student involved: Vinicius Silva (http://www.monografias.ufop.br/handle/35400000/4934)
> 
> Description: ...

3) **Generating and storing temporal collaboration networks**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
>
> Description: OpenAlex (https://openalex.org/) is An open and comprehensive catalog of scholarly papers, authors, and institutions. One has to generate and store temporal collaboration networks from the OpenAlex dataset, based on specific queries.

4) **Community detection in temporal networks**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Description: Implement community detection algorithms for temporal networks

5) **Robustness analysis in oscillator networks**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Previous students: Vinicius Fonseca, Suleimane Ducure, Douglas Barbosa
> 
> Description: The aim is to seek attack strategies that best destroy or keep synchronization.

6) **Simulation of spreading models on top of networks**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Students: Gabriel F. da Costa
> 
> Description: 
> Possibilities w.r.t. model: 
>- metapopulation on each node.
>- contact networks.
Possibilities w.r.t. development:
>- create a website that allows the user to upload his network;
>- create a NetLogo project to run the model on top of synthetic networks
>- implementation of spreading models on top of multilayer networks; temporal networks

7) **Development of a QGIS add-on to generate road networks from shape files**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Description: From a shape file with the roads of a region, one generates the road network, in which the nodes are roads and the connections occur when pairs of roads intersect.

8) **Correspondences between the structure of mobility networks and the spreading of COVID-19**
> Professor: Vander L. S. Freitas
> 
> Previous students: Suleimane Ducure
> Ref: https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311X00184820
