1) **Plant species recognition**
> Professors: Eduardo Luz and Gladston Moreira

> Students: Pedro Castro (Ph.D. candidate)

> Description: Plant species can be recognized by its leaf, flower, fruit, etc. The aim of this project is to investigate deep learning methods in the context of plant species recognition via images. See this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9667141/) for more information. Dataset available within the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921005965).

Results: We have interesting contributions so far. See this [paper](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?hl=pt-BR&user=20pViLEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate#:~:text=An%20End%2Dto%2DEnd%20Deep%20Learning%20System%20for%20Hop%20Classification) and this [paper](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?hl=pt-BR&user=20pViLEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate#:~:text=Dataset%20for%20Hop%20varieties%20classification) for more information.


2) ** Promoter prediction with deep learning **
> Professors: Eduardo Luz and Gladston Moreira

> Students: Lauro Moraes

> Description: Locating the promoter region in DNA sequences is of paramount importance in bioinformatics. This projetc aims to explore deep learning methods to the task. See the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001048252200419X) for more information.
