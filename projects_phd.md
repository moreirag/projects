## Network science / Complex networks / Complex systems <a name="networks"></a>

1) **Graph Neural Networks for time series forecast**

Professor: Vander Freitas and Gladston Moreira

> Student: Fernando Duarte

> Descrition: The goal of this project is to develop a forecasting model for time series data that is contained within the nodes of a network/graph. Our hypothesis is that time series from neighboring nodes influence each other, and should therefore be taken into account when building a forecast model for each individual node. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) are a potentially useful tool for this task, as they can leverage the graph topology when training the model. Instead of simply inputting the time series data for a given node, the model would also take into consideration the time series data for neighboring nodes. We are currently testing this approach to predict the number of COVID-19 cases in a set of cities, taking into account the previous time series data of neighboring cities in a mobility network, as the flow of people between cities can have a direct impact on disease propagation. Another application involves predicting traffic congestion by considering attributes such as flooding, rain, accidents, and previous slowness recordings within a road network.


## Multiobjective optimization <a name="moo"></a>

1) **Multi-objetive Problem: Guiding under uniformity measure in the decision space**

> Professor: Gladston Moreira

> Student: Open selection process 

> Descrition: It aims to develop approaches for multi-objective optimization that integrates a guiding criterion to promote the uniformity of solutions in the decision variable space into the search procedure. A good representation of solutions in the decision space is also important from the point of view of the decision-making process. See this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9037034).


## Machine Learning / Deep Learning <a name="machine-learning"></a>
1) **Plant species recognition**
> Professors: Eduardo Luz and Gladston Moreira

> Students: Pedro Castro (Ph.D. candidate)

> Description: Plant species can be recognized by its leaf, flower, fruit, etc. The aim of this project is to investigate deep learning methods in the context of plant species recognition via images. See this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9667141/) for more information. Dataset available within the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921005965).


2) **Promoter prediction with deep learning**
> Professors: Eduardo Luz and Gladston Moreira

> Students: Lauro Moraes

> Description: Locating the promoter region in DNA sequences is of paramount importance in bioinformatics. This projetc aims to explore deep learning methods to the task. See the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001048252200419X) for more information.
