# Ph.D.


## Network science / Complex networks / Complex systems <a name="networks"></a>

1)

Prfofessor: Vander Freitas and Gladston Moreira

> Student: Fernando Duarte

> Descrition: 


## Multiobjective optimization <a name="moo"></a>

1) ** Multi-objetive Problem: Guiding under uniformity measure in the decision space

> Prfofessor: Gladston Moreira

> Student: Open selection process 

> Descrition: It aims to develop approaches for multi-objective optimization that integrates a guiding criterion to promote the uniformity of solutions in the decision variable space into the search procedure. A good representation of solutions in the decision space is also important from the point of view of the decision-making process. See this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9037034).


## Machine Learning / Deep Learning <a name="machine-learning"></a>
1) **Plant species recognition**
> Professors: Eduardo Luz and Gladston Moreira

> Students: Pedro Castro (Ph.D. candidate)

> Description: Plant species can be recognized by its leaf, flower, fruit, etc. The aim of this project is to investigate deep learning methods in the context of plant species recognition via images. See this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9667141/) for more information. Dataset available within the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921005965).


2) **Promoter prediction with deep learning**
> Professors: Eduardo Luz and Gladston Moreira

> Students: Lauro Moraes

> Description: Locating the promoter region in DNA sequences is of paramount importance in bioinformatics. This projetc aims to explore deep learning methods to the task. See the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001048252200419X) for more information.
